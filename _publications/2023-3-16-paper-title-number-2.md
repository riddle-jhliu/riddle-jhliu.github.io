**Abstract**
The prediction of the damage mechanism of the concrete-soil multilayered medium subjected to underground explosion is a challenging task to address. In this paper, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics methodology is introduced to deal with the soil fragmentation and fracture propagation in concrete which are involved in the physical process of explosion in this double-layered medium. The Drucker–Prager constitutive model and the Holmquist–Johnson–Cook concrete constitutive model are employed to describe the dynamic behavior of the soil and concrete, respectively. Firstly, the numerical model was validated by two cases, namely the high velocity impact of an aluminium sphere on a concrete plate and the fracture propagation of rock medium under blast loading. Subsequently, the explosion in the three-dimensional concrete-soil multilayered medium involving millions of particles was simulated and investigated using GPU-accelerated smoothed particle hydrodynamics methodology. The numerical results obtained using smoothed particle hydrodynamics are compared against the available experimental data, which shows that the present SPH model can reproduce the failure pattern and fracture propagation of the concrete medium with cylindrical hole in the concrete plate and different burial depths of the explosive.
