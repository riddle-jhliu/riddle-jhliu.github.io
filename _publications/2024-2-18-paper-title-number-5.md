**Abstract**
Particle generation is important for particle-based methods. The reasonable initial particle distribution has a profound impact on the computational accuracy and the stability of particle-based methods. We propose a particle generation method that generates the body-fitted and uniform particles fast. This method first generates initial body-fitted and locally uniformly distributed particles on the geometric facets, following the spatial partitioning, particle hashing, particle sorting, particle merging. The surface particles become body-fitted and uniform. In addition, we also combine several other generation methods of boundary-level particles and inner particles to provide a unified framework for the pre-processing process of the SPH method. Some particle generation examples of complex geometric models demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. The proposed method can generate large-scale particles of complex geometric models, improve the handling capacity of pre-processing techniques and keep up with the scale of solvers.
