**Abstract**
 Many engineering problems involve coupling effects of multiple physical fields, which pose
significant challenges for numerical simulations. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a classic
meshfree particle method that offers distinct advantages in simulating multi-physics coupling problems and has been widely applied in various fields of sciences and engineering. This paper focuses on
recent advances in SPH and its applications in multi-physics simulations. The key topics include: (1)
mechano-thermal coupled problems, such as heat and mass transfer, high-speed impacts, casting processes, and additive manufacturing; (2) mechano-thermal-chemical coupled problems, with complex
scenarios including shaped charge jet formation and penetration effects, explosive welding, and underwater explosions; (3) mechano-thermal-electromagnetic coupled problems, including electromagnetic
flow control and “X-pinch” phenomena. Finally, the future development of the SPH method in simulating multi-physics coupling problems is discussed and prospected.
